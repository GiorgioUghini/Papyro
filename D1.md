## Specification
### Web Architecture
Describe here, with a diagram, the components of your web application and how
they interact. Highlight which parts belong to the application layer, data layer
or presentation layer. How did you ensure that HTML is not rendered server side?
4
### API
#### REST compliance
Describe here to what extent did you follow REST principles and what are the
reasons for which you might have decided to diverge. Note, you must not describe
the whole API here, just the design decisions.
#### OpenAPI Resource models
Describe here synthetically, which models you have introduced for resources.
### Data model
Describe with an ER diagram the model used in the data layer of your web
application. How these map to the OpenAPI data model?
## Implementation
### Tools used
The backend of the project is entirely developed in Javascript and runs with NodeJS.
As a base for the webserver we used ExpressJS, a NodeJS framework that sits on top of the native http module and enriches it with a series of functionality.
Its main advantage is the possibility to develop the web app using "middlewares", functions that each request executes in series and that improve code scalability with zero effort.
Express' main flaw is that it does not natively support promises, it uses callbacks instead, but this problem is easily solved with a simple wrapper function for the middlewares' callbacks (in the project it can be found under middlewares/asyncMiddlewares.js).
To provide a working swagger test environment, we used the "swagger-ui-express" module. We just had to provide the YAML file we wrote to it and run the middleware when the requested path matched '/backend/swaggerui', and the module created the entire swagger test environment for us.
We decided to use LESS instead of directly writing CSS (a choice that we found out to be unnecessary since we wrote less than 100 lines of LESS in the end), and it had to be compiled in the backend. We used the 'less-middleware' module which compiles the LESS files just once (on server startup) and the 'css-beautify' module to make it human-readable.
To provide an abstraction layer with the POSTGRES database, we used Sequelize, a complex but powerful libraries that provided us with a model to represent the database (the tables have been created by sequelize itself) and a query engine that allowed us to write 0 queries by hand through the entire project. It has the annoying problem of a badly written documentation, but by mixing it with the questions found on stackOverflow we never got stuck on anything for too long.
A quite simple tool that really came in handy is the dotenv module. It lets you create environment variables to pass to the application so that we could avoid to provide them each time with the command line. It was particularly useful because we had different setups for the project and the way it connected to the database, and we just had to add them them to the config file at the beginning of the project and then we completely forgot about it.
### Discussion
Describe here:
- How did you make sure your web application adheres to the provided OpenAPI
specification?

- Why do you think your web application adheres to common practices to partition
the web application (static assets vs. application data)
- Describe synthetically why and how did you manage session state, what are the
state change triggering actions (e.g., POST to login etc..).
We managed the session state using a JWT token, provided to the user when it logs into the application and added to a blacklist that is saved on db when the user logs out.
The main advantage of the JWT token is that it requires less accesses to the database than other types of tokens, since it store encrypted users data that are immediately available when it is decrypted on server. The only access it requires is to check whether it is not valid anymore because the user logged out. This, however, means a query on a table that has a single column and is really efficient on databases like Redis.
However, we did not need _that_ speed and we mainly chose it because it is an interesting and widely-used technology that was also fun to implement.
In out project there are 2 POST calls that create and destroy a session: /users/login to create a session, that returns a JWT token with the Bearer schema, and /users/logout, that destroys the session and does not return anything.
The api calls that need a valid user to work get it from the JWT, so they do not need access to the database
- Which technology did you use (relational or a no-SQL database) for managing
the data model?
We managed the data model with a relational database (Postgres), because we did not need the full speed of a non-relational database and we find the relational model easier to implement and maintain  
## Other information
### Task assignment
Describe here how development tasks have been subdivided among members of the
group, e.g.:
- Foo worked on front end (80%) and OpenAPI Spec (20% of the time)
- Bar worked on ....
### Analysis of existing API
Describe here if you have found relevant APIs that have inspired the OpenAPI
5
specification and why (at least two).
### Learning outcome
What was the most important thing all the members have learned while developing
this part of the project, what questions remained unanswered, how you will use
what you've learned in your everyday life?
Examples:
- Foo learned to write SQL queries and Javascript but wanted to know more about
caching, he's probably going to create his own startup with what she has
learned
- Bar learned how to deploy on a cloud platform, he would have liked to know
more about promises for asynchronous code..
